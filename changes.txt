Potential changes to code and general notes:

inputfeature:
	- do we want to use this feature at all? what about other features... complex spectral difference etc?
	sub-band filters are not stable unless order is cut in two.

	l.98	subBand = subBand .* (subBand > 0) .^2; % as implemented by Fabien but this doesn't square
		%	subBand = ( subBand .* (subBand > 0) ) .^2; % this version squares the result
	the former of these DOESN'T square the subBand... but it should do. 

	l.102		dsSubBand = decimate(subBand,dsFactor);
	should make sure that this is non-negative... 

	l.123		feature(i,ct) = sum((smoothDsSubBand(pin+1:pin+winlen)));
	really want to take the 'abs' of this.


ssimDescs:

	l.16 	fullAcf = max(xcorr(feature, corrSize, 'coeff'),0);  
	do we want to take the 'unbiased' acf instead of the biased one? (probably the lags are short enough that it doesn't matter

	l.110	acf_2 = max(xcorr(seq, NPointsPerBeat+1, 'coeff'),0); % do as before by HWR the acf
	do we want to do some smoothing between the concatenated frames in seq? there's bound to be some discontinuities here


microtDescs:

	l.57 	aveBeatPattern = mean(pattern,2);
	we could do k-means here instead of just taking the mean

	l.91 	descs(1) = max(dev1); %% SYSTEMATIC MICROTIMING
	l.92 	descs(2) = mean(dev1);
	l.93 	descs(3) = max(dev2);
	l.94 	descs(4) = mean(dev2);
	not totally sure what these mean.


periodfuncDescs:

	l.69	beats_II(beats_II > length(feature)) = []; % fabien doesn't have this line, but i think it's needed
	need to remove beats off the end of the featureFs

	l.89    v_fast(i) = var(feature(beats_fast(i):min(length(feature),beats_fast(i+1))));
	l.99    v_slow(i) = var(feature(beats_slow(i):min(length(feature),beats_slow(i+1))));
	should these be calculated between beats or around beats?
	also, should it be up to beats_fast(i+1)-1 , and likewise for beats_slow? 

	l.116 	descs(3) = sum(dev)/length(beats_fast); 
	should this be abs? if not.. what does it represent?

	l.146	limCorr = ceil(5*featureFs/length(beats_veryFast));
	still not really sure what this line does... or why the correlation length is limited by the number of fast beats.. I guess they are the number of observations? 


	l.161	onBeat = zeros(1,length(feature));
	should there be a similar declaration for the off-beat? there isn't in the original code.. the same thing is defined twice...  not defining it seems to make a small difference
